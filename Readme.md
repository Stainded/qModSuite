# qModSuite
This plugin is a project made by Frozenorb as a stable implementation for potpvpsi which was a practice plugin project for an old project called minehq which was one of the most well thought out and worked on servers of the century at that time.
I am not the original author of all the code and maintenance of the project and just an organizer that will lay out here more fully how it works, what it depends on and what it really can or will need.


## Features
This project has nametag provenance visibility, team member visibility, repo requests, staff check requests, usable items, open chests in silent mode, and a menu to see active team members.
In item usability are cited items that can get you "boost, inspect inventory, item to edit world, responsible for visibility, see staff online, last pvp"
